1)  Why we need ad-hoc ansible commands, give scenario where you have used ansible ad-hoc commands?
It is individual running commands, which can be run individually to perform quick functions.
Itâ€™s not use for configuration management and deployment because the commands are of one-time usage.
Ad-hoc commands uses the /user/bin/ansible command line tool to automate the signal task.
Ansible -m "yum" -a "name=tree state=preset" -vvv (verbose to see detailed logs) 

2) Uscase of Ansible module ?
  Ansible -i inventory -m ping
  Ansible -i inventory -m setup

3) How to run a playbook on particular group in inventory. 
   ansible-playbook -i 'my-inventory.ini' -i 'host3,' playbook.yaml

4) How to run a playbook on perticular ip
  ansible-playbook -i 10.254.3.133, site.yml

5) What is vault in ansible.
 Ansible allows keeping sensitive data such as passwords or keys in encrypted files, rather than a plain text in your playbooks. 
Create a new encrypted Playbook 
[ansible]$ ansible-vault create Zeevault.yml 
Edit the encrypted playbook 
[ansible]$ ansible-vault edit Shanvault.yml 
To change the password of Playbook 
[ansible]$ ansible-vault rekey Shanvault.yml
 6) When i need detailed log on execution ansible playbook what option i need to use?-vvv ( 3 v's for verbose )

7) Write a playbook to install enginx using handlers.
- - - #My handlers Playbook

- name: install HTTPD server on centos 7
action: yum name=httpd state=installed
notify: restart httpd
handlers:
- name: restart httpd

8) Roles directory structure.
 Command to create role -- ansible-galaxy init <ROLE_NAME>
Directory Structure:
Defaults:
Files:
Handlers:
Meta:
Tasks:

Tests:
Vars:

9) Define roles in ansible.
We can use 2 technologies for reusing a set of task: includes and roles. 
Roles are good for organizing task and encapsulating data needed to accomplish those tasks. 
We can organize playbook into a directory structure called Roles. 
Adding more and more functionality to the playbooks will make it different to maintain in a single file.
10) Can we group the VMs in ansible inventories.
Yes
[demo]
Ip addresses1
Ip addresses2

[test]
Ip addresses3
Ip addresses4

10) Default port for ssh
22
11) What is ansible.cfg file?
 It contains important Ansible settings that control how Ansible operates
12) use line in file module while creating the playbook
- name: add lines
  lineinfile: 
    dest: fruits.txt
    line: '{{ item }}'
  with_items:
    - 'Orange'
    - 'Apple'
    - 'Banana'


13) copy module in ansible.
- name: Copy file with owner and permissions
  copy:
    src: /srv/myfiles/foo.conf
    dest: /etc/foo.conf

14)  Ansible playbook to ping a server.
